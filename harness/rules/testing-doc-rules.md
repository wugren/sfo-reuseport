# Testing Document Rules

## Goal
- Define optional persistent testing artifacts and the required post-implementation testing responsibilities.

## Scope
- `docs/versions/<version>/modules/<module>/testing.md`
- `docs/versions/<version>/modules/<module>/testing/`
- `docs/versions/<version>/modules/<module>/<submodule>/testing.md` when a large module is split into direct submodule packets
- `docs/versions/<version>/modules/<module>/testplan.yaml`
- `docs/versions/<version>/modules/<module>/<submodule>/testplan.yaml` when a large module is split into direct submodule packets

## Metadata For Optional Testing Documents
- `module`
- `version`
- `status`
- `approved_by`
- `approved_at`

## Required Content
- test cases designed after implementation from proposal, design, and delivered code
- submodule test coverage mapped to design and implementation
- module-level verification
- external interface verification
- validation rationale that ties checks to concrete behaviors, risks, or success criteria
- definition of done
- stable test entrypoints, optionally aligned with `testplan.yaml`
- direct change coverage for implemented work
- stable `change_id` values matching proposal and design items
- explicit gap records where direct validation does not yet exist
- large-module submodule test documentation when design uses direct submodules

## Guardrails
- Testing must operationalize approved proposal/design intent against the delivered implementation.
- Testing tasks run after implementation completes and MUST inspect `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and the delivered code before designing test cases.
- Testing tasks are single-stage by default and MUST NOT edit `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `design/`, acceptance artifacts, or production code unless the user explicitly requested those additional stages.
- Testing tasks may modify test code, test fixtures, test runners, and optional testing artifacts.
- Testing tasks may modify unified test entrypoint wiring when needed to register the generated tests.
- Testing tasks must not rewrite proposal, design, or production implementation artifacts.
- If proposal/design split a large module into direct submodules and optional testing artifacts are generated, those artifacts MUST mirror that split using submodule packets under the large module directory, such as `docs/versions/<version>/modules/<module>/<submodule>/testing.md` and `testplan.yaml`, not `testing/<submodule>/`.
- Human-authored testing docs SHOULD stay under 1000 lines each. Any testing document that would exceed 1000 lines MUST be split by submodule, responsibility, validation layer, or interface boundary and the test document index MUST be updated.
- Every implemented change should have direct validation coverage or an explicit gap.
- Every implemented `change_id` should map to a validation id and a generated test implementation or optional `testplan.yaml` step unless the validation path is explicitly `manual` or `disabled`.
- Every generated or changed automated test MUST be reachable through `harness/scripts/test-run.py`.
- Testing is not complete until `uv run --active python ./harness/scripts/test-run.py <module> all` reaches the module tests and `uv run --active python ./harness/scripts/test-run.py all all` reaches all project tests registered with the harness.
- Validation paths should prove a named behavior or risk; do not add unrelated checks as evidence.
- If a layer is `manual` or `disabled`, the reason should appear in generated test evidence and optional testing metadata when present.
- If a testing task discovers an upstream design or implementation problem, return work to the owning design or implementation stage instead of widening test scope silently.
- If a testing change implies acceptance updates, record the downstream follow-up unless the user explicitly requested cross-stage synchronization.
